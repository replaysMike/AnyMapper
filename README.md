A CSharp library mapping alternative to AutoMapper with built-in support for Entity Framework 6 and Entity Framework Core. The terse mapper!

## Description

AnyMapper was built as a standalone object mapper that runs on either .Net Framework or .Net Core. The API is backwards compatible with AutoMapper so switching between the two is nearly seamless.

## Differences from AutoMapper

AnyMapper will automatically map between objects of different types as long as they have the same names and the types are the same or are different but convertable automatically.

## Examples

Coming shortly!
